    }
}
```

6. Load osm file to your db
7. run raw SQL (`INITIAL_MIGRATION`) written in settings.py to init db 
8. Locate console to project

### How to play
1. This game is designed for two players (reds vs. blues)
2. A player can do only one action in a single step
..1. Manipulate population - assign population living in a city / town or village within the selected area on the map to increase a player's score
..2. Invest - increases area of effect
3. Player who controlls most of the country is the winner

### Important scenarios
1. Show three towns (cities) closest to the selected point (only towns (cities) with population higher than 10.000) - educative scenario
2. Get portion from non-manipulated area 
3. Remove polygon from 2nd step from non-manipulated area
4. Get population of towns (cities, villages) which are inside the selected polygon from step 2
5. Delete non-manipulated area and copy a new polygon of the whole Slovakia as a new non-manipulated area on every refresh of the page (new game)
